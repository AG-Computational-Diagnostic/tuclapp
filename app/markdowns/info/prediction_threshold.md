
### Prediction Threshold

Here you see a histogram of the prediction scores across the whole slide and all classes (above the slider). With the slider itself you can exclude patches with a certain low prediction score. I.e., all patches with a prediction score less than set on this slider are classified as `Below Threshold`. A new value on the slider will take effect once you click `Update slide result`.
